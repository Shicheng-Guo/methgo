{"name":"MethGo","tagline":"a comprehensive tool for analyzing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data","body":"# MethGo\r\nDNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification regulating several biological\r\nprocesses. A standard approach in the study of DNA methylation is bisulfite\r\nsequencing (BS-Seq). BS-Seq couples bisulfite conversion of DNA with next\r\ngeneration sequencing to provide a genome wide profile of DNA methylation at\r\nsingle base resolution. The analysis of BS-Seq data involves the use of\r\ncustomized aligners for mapping reads and additional bioinformatic pipelines for\r\ndownstream data analysis. While most post-alignment programs generate\r\nmethylation calls, MethGo carries out subsequent genomic and epigenomic analyses\r\nto comprehensively explore BS-Seq datasets.\r\n\r\nMethGo is a simple and effective tool designed for the analysis of data from\r\nwhole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and reduced representation bisulfite\r\nsequencing (RRBS). MethGo provides 5 major modules:\r\n\r\n- COV: Coverage distribution of each cytosine\r\n- MET: Both global and gene-centric cytosince methylation levels\r\n- TXN: Cytosine methylation levels at transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs)\r\n- SNP: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling\r\n- CNV: Copy Number variation calling\r\n\r\n![Overview of MethGo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wwliao/methgo/master/docs/_static/overview.png)\r\n\r\nMethGo is available under the terms of the MIT license.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n- [Documentation](https://methgo.readthedocs.org/)\r\n- [Source code](https://github.com/wwliao/methgo/)\r\n- [Project page](https://wwliao.github.io/methgo/)","google":"UA-57212281-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
